Are we going away, Daddy?
I wouldn't imagine where.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
She's the best damn witness we have!
That's all you've had all this time?

What does she do for you?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Ten thousand sounds high.
Who's it for? A relative?
I'll give you his beeper.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
But then you told her you were home.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
She don't know shit about the money.
No, I give it to someone else first.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
I lived there for about nine months.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I know you don't know. I said guess.

Three nights... two days.
In your pocket, please...
I don't know where he is.
Was there visual contact?

She never gave me a tape.
Alright.  We're going up.
Those two guys were cops.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
So the guy's not a sicko.
Right.  That explains it.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

I talked to him.
Sounds like fun.
What do you want from me?
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
This better be important.
He thinks he looks young.
I don't carry it with me.
The little piggie speaks.

Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.

They're out of Glenlivet.

Who's your booking agent?
Oh.  Where is this place?
I mean, I need the money.
So what's the difference?
What are they doing here?
Don't call me ever again.
...through the kitchen...
I know she's coming back.
They're a finesse team...
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
How's it going? It's been a while...
You haven't been drinking, have you?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.

You were going to Venice.
He says so many fianc�es.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Well, we ate everything without you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
That ring's so great. The green one.

The bay doesn't.
Are you staying?
I'm glad you do.

Well, you're the lawyer. 
Tell him about the party.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
After the gulls attacked.
Really? Tell me about it.
You look a little shaken.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
I think they'll be all right, honey.
See them two big trees across there?
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Well... well, is everyone all right?

Gray killed her.
Get out of here!
You can get out.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
What do you mean, Fettes?
We can't be sure of that.
A pleasure to torment me?
I take no gifts from you.
I've had some experience.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Why don't you do it then?
You're not going to Gray.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
But where did they get those people?

But you, you've had them.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
Good thing in a situation like this.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
Good for you. You do know something.
You want me to walk a straight line?

Chill out Edgar.
I can't do that!
Closet monster!?
Ouch, my hair...
You have a T.V.?
This is Michael.
Still mad at me?
Where's Michael?
Lights out, Sam.
Should I run him through?
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
I told Max eight o'clock.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's already gone to bed.
What would that make Mom?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.

We can't talk about it on the phone.

Right.  Why not?
Damn if I won't.
Move it, Palmer.
What do you want from us?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Then we'll never make it.
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!

It was meant to.
But you escaped.
Now will you go?
Dance with me...

That's absurd --
Do you find her?
Or mud carriers.
Is he all right?
Do you have it?!
Might I ask why?
I am the oldest.
Sir, if I may --
But there's nothing here.
Now how did you get hurt?
Because you'll never die.
So you take their best...
Why is it -- breaking up?
I need... to talk to you.
Go back to your own time?
You can see so many here.
His curiosity is amazing.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
You know that's not true.
Where do they take them?!
I took a different route.
I am.  Are you a climber?
What did you do at night?
For our sake, I hope not.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.

So it's helping?
You remember it?
Why "of course"?
But... what about Starks?
Do you really believe me?
[Beat] You bled to death.
And how do you know that?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Well, how'd you get here?
Of course you don't know.
Well, where are you from?
You sure you know where to find one?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
That when you stopped being a nurse?

In case of what?
Where you goin'?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Thelma kinda took to him.
That's puttin' it mildly.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
I'll call you right back.
We're fine!  How are you?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
So how come you don't have any kids?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You know what's happened, don't you?
You think you've found your calling?
You left that guy alone in the room?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?

The list is long, but distinguished.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.

You better get down here.
Suppose I do...then what?
O.K., everybody pull out!
He's not at ground level.
I think you better leave.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.

Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.

No, Phil.  It's a mammal.

I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
I couldn't have done it without you.
I just brought you something to eat.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Is that what you were trained to do?
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
You're officer of the watch, George.

Bad idea.
You okay?
Prove it.
Not ever.
Not ever?
Bullshit.
What for?
Aren't you glad?
How old is Anna?
K through sixth.
You walked home.
Lovers' quarrel?
How do you know?
But will he... ?
What's her name?
This is garbage!
I see my sister.
Close your eyes.
Go home, Walter.
Fuck you, Rosen!
That was a joke.
I need a shower.
What's going on?
It's a bad idea.
Move in with me.
Are you serious?
They seduce you?
No. Never again.
What about them?
K through sixth.
See anything interesting?
You should hear the bird.
What will happen if I do?
Do you have many friends?
Don't ever do that again.
Please don't do it again.
I never hurt them. Never.
How about in the morning.
Hey, that was... intense.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
Then why are you talking about this?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
All three -- in chronological order.
What's the worst thing you ever did?

Hi, lady.
Now what?
Who else?
Your rig?
Uh, oh...
How deep?
Nice shot, Lins.
What's the plan?
Jesus, Lindsey--
That must be it.
Wasn't up to me.
He's convulsing!
You got it?!  You got it?
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
What do you think he saw?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
What's the timer set for?
He's hallucinating badly.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
What are you still wearing that for?
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.

Late, very late.
No reason why...
We'll try again.
And who is this?
What other boat?
That's why I asked you...
Then why do you say them?
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Don't you ever paint men?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
I know, I know. One thing at a time.

For what?
H... how?
Who am I?
Yes I am.
Like you?
Anything.
Anything?
From God.
Everyone.
Sister...
Thanks...
The baby?
Yes I do.
Bullshit!
Aquittal.
She'd punish me.
What did you do?
So she sent you?
You can tell me.
What did you do?
What did you do?
I was a mistake.
She'd get angry.
Are you married?
Something I ate.
Why should they?
Why would I lie?
You just said...
What's his name?
I can beat that.
Two packs a day.
That's not what he meant.
One of the other Sisters?
He talked to you Himself?
As much as God loves you.
Because I don't want one.
I've stopped menstruating
Do you have any children?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
She didn't want any help.
You're saying God did it?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Because I didn't know... 
Oh, some time in January.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Everything... I don't have children.
Where do you think babies come from?
First thing that comes to your mind?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
So, someone else could have done it.

No, straight up.
Should I say it?
How'd you guess?
Don't dramatise.
Give 'em a pull.
Aye, well, now! 
Oh you do, look.
Oh, leave off!!!
You've lost him.
Good lad, Ringo.
Clever.  George.
He can't be far.
The cards... you're bank.

Oh aye, but I thought ...

You can learn from books.
What are you doing there?
No, that's his other one.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, he can't stop here.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.

Feast your eyes.
We do know that.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Oh... God... am I cold...
What the hell's going on?
We've got six hours left.
I think it's fizzled out.
What's happening up here?
We're not going anywhere.
That'll blow the ship up.
Which presumably means...
Or something will be able to see us.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?

And before that?
Think I spoke too soon...
Six month stint on Datus.

We never met. That's why.
Right here. A minute ago.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Happy little housewife...
Now you want an argument.
There can't be very much-
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
I detest cheap sentiment.
With gestures, of course.
That's on time for Margo.
I don't think I could be.

You want to make me look like him...
As different as it's possible to be.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

In money.

En garde.

That's the idea.
I'm not fifteen.
Of course it is.
Is it all right?
It is all right.
He was American?
Lay on, MacDuff.
What's going on?
How do you know?
I don't see him.
What's he up to?
Do you know him?
Who invited you?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
Reggie -- listen to me --
I heard you, I heard you.
How was I leading you on?
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
Only we call them agents.
You'd lie about anything.
It's all right with us --
You mean, you're a thief?
Why can't you be serious?
Reggie -- listen to me --
The money is unimportant.
Up there! It is up there!
Words can hurt very much.
I don't know where to go.
Instant divorce you mean?
Is your husband with you?
Because I don't love him.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
You're going to look for him -- now?
Why do you think I brought you here?
You don't look so bad in this light.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
You mean spies and things like that?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
How about once more around the park?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
The man and the woman are married --
Do you know what you're going to do?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.

Who is that guy?
Where you going?
What? I can't hear you...
What are you going to do?
Where is Sidney's father?
I think he's doing Dolly.
I could use some therapy.
We had to have financing.
So we found a compromise.
This is all too familiar.
Can we turn the light on?
I never meant to imply...
What do you want from me?
I got a surprise for you.
She's not here right now.

And why is that?
Are you serious?
I'm not worried.
It's past seven.
She can't get both of us.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
You have to move on, Sid.
You know that's not true.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
But you're doing so well.
Michael... Michael Myers.
Don't do this. I can't...
How do you know his name?

That's not what you said.
Do you like scary movies?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
It happens. Take it easy.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
That fish smelled strong.
Can you see me right now?
That's the original part.
Do you believe this shit?
I did. He's full of shit.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
You know what my dad will do to you?
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.

Perfect example.

You know that's not true.
You know he's fucking us.
Oh, you want to stay now?
I don't.  Neither do you.
We don't know for sure...
No witnesses of any kind?
Is there any blood in it?

I don't think of us that way - ever.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Seems more like a year than a month.
--------
who's your daddy?
Sorry I--
Whatever.
Bad news.
Not ever. Never.
Never say never.
I didn't forget.
He phoned it in.
Well? Surprised?
I'm warning you.
Rules are rules.
What gives, Don Corleone?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
So you'll think about it?
You do know how to drive?
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
Eventually you'll let go.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
I'll make you very proud.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
You'll never believe who's in there.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
You have changed since second grade.
We own a small family grocery store.

You okay?
How long?
Sam!  Hi!
I'm here.
How much?
You look pretty.
Eat a power bar.
And the child...
Oh, Ray... no...
Where, the mall?
Say you love me.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Did you try to fight him?
Will you do me one favor?
You have someplace to be?
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Where's this coming from?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
I'm not on your property!
You notice my new jumper?
So, where you off to now?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?

All what?
Try what?
Jim West.
Easy now.
I know!  I know!
I'll work on it.
Funny.  So am I.
Fine, I'll stop.
Now it's a bomb.
It's better than nothing.
My disguise.  And here...
What about the explosive?
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
You need that real often?
But it only has six legs.
This is Colonel Richards.
We'll explain on the way.
Are those just button buttons or...?
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
You're not going to use it, are you?

Let's go.
Say what?
Watch it!
His will.
Kill him!
Kill him!
No.  I mean yes.
Friend of yours?
Miserable Pecks.
Courage, Willow.
He never misses.
Here.  Hold her.
Who is that girl, anyway?
I will!  But I need help!
The limitless power of...
That's all I ever wanted!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.

witness
Yes, sir.
Two days.
How long?
Whacking?
Probably.
Pick up the hat.
No pistol. Ever.
A real fireball.
Oh. The bullets.
Only the elders.
No, no doctor...
It's not a joke.
What's so funny?
Everything okay?
Good, you start tomorrow.
What are you going to do?
...I want to say a thing.
How reliable is this kid?
Anything against zippers?
You'd lie to protect him.
I don't know where he is.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
They don't have any shit.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

If she...
Our echo.
Ahh!  Ah!
...paper?
Stop her!
We might.
A home --
...along.
Yes, you.
Yeah. Me?
Mr. Gale!
Oh -- all right.
That's our farm!
And him a brain.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Did I scare you?
Leave her alone!
Oh, scared, huh?
Her -- her name is Emily.
Now you're seeing reason.
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Well, you're perfect now.
Because I'm still scared!
How about a hippopotamus?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Where do you want to be oiled first?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Did you just hear what I just heard?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
She - she can have my Witch Remover.

the world is not enough
We can�t.
The name?
Oh James.
Istanbul.
No! Bond!
How appropriate.
No!  Get me out!
This is the end.
She�s not a girl anymore.
He used your exact words.
The parcel�s in the post.
What the hell are you talking about?
It is my oil!  Mine and my family�s!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.

What class sub does your nephew run?

Laurie --
His what?
A whore fucking.
Veidt�s complex.
I won't do that.
Where did he go?
What's he doing?
Am I free to go?
New information.
Why?  What's the problem?
God isn't there to do it.
And what if you�re wrong?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Dan -- what do we do now?
Don't look.  Turn around.
Janey, will you marry me?
Isn't it true that you --
Their real names, please.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.

Up yours.
You okay?
Sit down.
Are you alright?
What's the deal?
What weapons do you have?
Did you do your homework?
When can I see you again?
Nothing. He had two days.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.

How nice.
A piece of what?
Can you play it?
Was he any good?
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
And I have mine.
You have the wrong house.
Give him an extra dollar.
Whatever makes you happy.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
My father was a sick man.
Just putting up some tea.
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
Why don't we talk inside?
I think I'll...carry him.
What are you going to do?
And look at this, Doctor!
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
How long will this whole thing take?
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
What's that tune that you're playing
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
